🚀 C# BASIC EXAMPLES-LEARNING PROJECT COLLECTION
---
Welcome to the C# Basic Examples repository a complete learning resource designed for beginners who want to practice and understand core C# programming concepts through clean, simple, and functional console applications.

This repository is perfect for:
---
✔️ Students
✔️ Programming beginners
✔️ Anyone learning C# fundamentals
✔️ Anyone preparing for exams or practice sessions

Each folder contains independent examples, all written with clarity and comments to help you learn step-by-step.

📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE
---
Below is a full breakdown of all folders currently in this repository:

📌 Digit_Extraction_and_Sum_Calculator_in_C#
---
A program that:
* Takes a three-digit number from the user
* Extracts the hundreds, tens, and ones digits
* Displays each digit separately
* Calculates and prints the sum of all digits

Great for learning:
* Modulus (%)
* Division
* Basic number manipulation

📌 For&While_Example
---
A set of examples demonstrating:
* for loops (counting, repeating actions, controlled iteration)
* while loops (condition-based repetition)
* User & driven loops
* Practical usage of loop logic

Helpful for understanding how repetition works in C# programs.

📌 If_&_Else_Examples
---
Covers conditional statements using:
* if
* else if
* else
* Logical operators (&&, ||, !)

Includes examples such as:

* Score/grade evaluation
* City validation
* Password & username checks
* Value comparison scenarios

Perfect for mastering decision-making structures.

📌 Independent_Sample_Structures
---
A collection of standalone mini-programs focused on algorithmic thinking.
Each example is self_contained and demonstrates specific logic concepts such as:
* Basic calculations
* Input/output formatting
* Small simulations
* Logical decision structures
Excellent for practicing without relying on external code.

📌 IntDoubleCharString
---
Examples demonstrating the most important data types in C#:
* int(integers)
* double(decimal numbers)
* char(single characters)
* string(text values)

You will learn:
* Declaring variables
* Reading user input
* Type conversion
* Printing formatted output
* Performing arithmetic operations

📌 Mod_Usage_Examples
---
Shows how to use the modulus operator (%) effectively.

Examples include:
* Calculating remainders
* Checking even/odd numbers
* Math-based logic problems
* Divisibility conditions
A key concept for algorithmic problem solving.

📌 Parse_Examples
---
Focuses on converting user input from string to numeric types, including:
* int.Parse()
* double.Parse()
* char.Parse()
* Use cases for input validation
Essential for any program that accepts user input.

📌 Methods_Examples
---
This folder teaches how to use methods effectively in C#.

Covered method types include:

✔️ Void Methods
Simple actions with no return value
(e.g., printing a customer list)

✔️ Methods with Parameters
Passing values into methods
(string, int, etc.)

✔️ Return-Type Methods
Returning information back to the caller
(string returns, integer returns)

✔️ Realistic Examples
Such as an exam average calculator that returns a pass/fail message

This module helps you understand:
* Reusability
* Clean code structure
* Input/output handling
* How real applications structure logic using methods

📌 Foreach_Examples ⭐ Newly Added
---
Includes examples showing how to use the foreach loop with arrays and lists.
Covers:
* Iterating through color and number arrays
* Printing only even numbers
* Reading characters from a List<char>
* A mid level project: International Student Evaluation System, where SAT, ACT, and TOEFL scores are taken, normalized, averaged, and evaluated.
