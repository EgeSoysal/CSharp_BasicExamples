🚀 C# BASIC EXAMPLES – LEARNING PROJECT COLLECTION

Welcome to the C# Basic Examples repository — a curated set of beginner-friendly console applications created to help you understand and practice fundamental C# programming concepts.

This repository is ideal for students, beginners, and anyone who wants to strengthen their foundations in C# through real working examples.

📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE

Below is the breakdown of all folders exactly as they appear in your repository:

📌 Digit_Extraction_and_Sum_Calculator_in_C#

A program that analyzes a three-digit number, extracts each digit (hundreds, tens, ones), and calculates the sum of all digits.
Great for learning arithmetic operations and modulus/division logic.

📌 For&While_Example

Shows how to use for and while loops in different scenarios.
Includes counting loops, conditional loops, and user-interactive looping processes.

📌 If_&_Else_Examples

Demonstrates conditional logic using if, else if, and else statements.
Includes examples such as:

* Score evaluation
* City verification
* Password and username checks
* Comparison operations

📌 Independent_Sample_Structures

A collection of standalone mini-programs that focus on logical operations and algorithmic thinking.
Each example is independent and showcases a specific concept or logic flow.

📌 IntDoubleCharString

Covers essential C# data types:

* int
* double
* char
* string

Includes examples of:
* Declaring variables
* Reading user input
* Printing formatted output
* Performing arithmetic operations

📌 Mod_Usage_Examples

Demonstrates how to use the modulus (%) operator.
Examples include:
* Remainder operations
* Even/odd number checking
* Basic math-based logic

📌 Parse_Examples

Shows how to convert user input into different data types using:
* int.Parse()
* double.Parse()
* char.Parse()

Great for learning how to properly handle console input and type conversion.
